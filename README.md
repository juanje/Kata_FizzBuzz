# Kata FizzBuzz

This is a exercise that Ronny Ancorini ([@RonnyAnc](https://github.com/RonnyAnc)) used as demo for the TDD workshop at [LPA DevOps](https://github.com/LasPalmasDevOps).

The demo was implemented in Java, but I'd like to solve the same problem in Ruby. Following the same metodology, but trying to find my own solution.

## The problem

For a given number, return the sequence from 1 to that number but with the following sustitutions:

* If the number is **not divisible** by **2** or **3**, then the number will **not** be changed.
* If the number is divisible by **2**, then sustitute the number by the word "**Fizz**".
* If the number is divisible by **3**, then sustitute the number by the word "**Buzz**".
* If the number is divisible by **2** and by **3**, then sustitute the number by the word "**FizzBuzz**".

## Examples

**Example 1:** If the passed number is **2**, the output should be:

```
  1
  Fizz
```

**Example 2:** If the passed number is **7**, the output should be:

```
  1
  Fizz
  Buzz
  Fizz
  5
  FizzBuzz
  7
```
